I-Exercises session

DTW
numerical sequice
DNA sequences
voices with letters

II-Audio control word recognition system
capstral coefficient *12
MFCC coefficients
MFCC->Mel frequency cepstral coefficients
toolbox librosa, windows*12

-> Own study

use corpus with french words and compare with your own voice
e.g. :
10 files learning basis : gather reference oder/records
5 files test basis : gather test order
each test file âˆ’> apply DTW
=> recognize the file order that givs minimal cost in DTW

III-Comparison between PCA reduction and key nearest neighbours
take the average among all the windows

PCA reduction of the vector of 12 windows and create a 3D vector fo each file
(only on learning basis)

KNN -> compute all distances of all the files in the test basis to the learning basis

to deliver :
- notebook / report(8 pages)
-study
